We can use the muscle sensor for multiple muscle groups (positions) around the arm adn get data out for a particular set of arm movements (finger orientations)
then we can wirte a code that would take multiple channels of this dataset and create a Data enrty that corressponds to a single hand movement using myo data
from multiple positions. You know what it means. 

Movement                    MyoPostion1          MyoPostion2        MyoPostion3        ( each position values to be recorded separately )
Close Fist                     Values               Values              Values        (To be given by the code)

Once all the data is set we can compare it to already existing datasets of prosthetic arms in production for accuracy, speed, durablity and ergonomics.
The paper would be written on the above statement
